# Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
## ASSIGNMENT 1 (for Lecture 1)

Question 1
----------

Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence `The man saw the woman with a telescope`, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman
has the telescope.


<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>1. The man saw the woman through his telescope.
        </p>
        <p>2. The man saw the woman who had a telescope.
        </p>
</details>

Question 2
----------
For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:

1. Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway.
2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
3. Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.

    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>1. Sisters reunited in checkout line at safeway after 10 years apart.
        </p>
        <p>2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into fixing it.
        </p>
        <p>3. Mayor says all bus passengers should fasten their seat belts.
        </p>
</details>


Question 3
---------

The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room: `No head injury is too trivial to ignore.`
Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong
that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>Every head injury is serious enough to pay attention to it.
        </p>
</details>



Question 4
=========

You often see the following notice posted in elevators: `In case of fire, do not use elevator.`
This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended
second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)

<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>Meaning_1: If the building is on fire, do not use the elevator.
        </p>
        <p>Meaning_2: Do not use the elevator in case doing so causes a fire.
        </p>
        <p> Formulation: If somewhere in the building is burning, the use of elevator is prohibited.
        </p>
</details>


Question 5
=========

Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the
bottom: `This page intentionally left blank.`
Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement?
What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again,
the context means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no
problem. But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth
century destroyed one prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in
an entire branch of mathematics.)

<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>1. The statement is false because the page is truly not blank. It already has the statement 'This page intentionally left blank.' on it.
        </p>
        <p>2. Its purpose is to let the ready not wonder if the blank page was an error
        </p>
        <p>3. Reformulation: This page contains nothing but this sentence
        </p>
</details>


Question 6
=========

Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is
(clearly) not what the writer intended. (This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is
very common.)

<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>1. She was on the phone.
        </p>
        <p>2. Call me a taxi please.
        </p>
        <p>3. The child hid the toy he found under the bed.
        </p>
</details>

Question 7
=========

Comment on the sentence “The temperature is hot today.” You hear people say things like this
all the time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in
mathematics would be disastrous.

<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
        <p>Temperature can be high/low
        </p>
        <p>Weather can be hot or cold. Do not mix both.
        </p>
</details>

Question 8
----------

How would you show that not every number of the form N = (p1 · p2 · p3 · . . . · pn) + 1 is prime,
where p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn , . . . is the list of all prime numbers?

<details>
    <summary> Answer </summary>
    <p> This is related to Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many
primes. Find an n for which (p1 ... pn) + 1 is not prime.</p>
<p>(2 x 3) + 1 = 7 (7 is prime)</p>
<p>(2 x 3 x 5) + 1 = 31 (31 is prime)</p>
<p>(2 x 3 x 5 x 7) + 1 = 211 (211 is prime)</p>
<p>(2 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13) + 1 = 30031 (30031 is not prime because 59 x 509)</p>

Question 1
----------

succession, with no other word between those five occurrences. (You are allowed to use punctuation.)

Question 2
----------

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the words `and`, `or`, `and`, `or`, `and` occur
in that order, with no other word between them. (Again, you can use punctuation.)
